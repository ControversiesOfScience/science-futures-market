## The Information Market

An information market is a place where people can place wagers on future events.  The approach has sometimes proven accurate in predicting the results of presidential elections.

## ... But as a Reality Check for Ideology in the Sciences

The comments box is broken.

Every day, people go online to inform one another about their scientific worldview.

Many thousands of people do this online today because there's essentially no cost to do so ...

... and by cost, I don't just mean that Internet access is ridiculously cheap; I also mean that there's just no penalty for being wrong.

This creates an amazing amount of noise insofar as the loudest voices are not necessarily the best representatives.  The savvy information consumer is still tasked with identifying the best arguments for a particular claim.  This process can be extremely time-consuming, and most people give up at the first rebuttal to an extraordinary idea -- as if the argument always stops just a level deep.

It sometimes seems online that the science comments box is all ugly babies ...

Everybody's got a pet theory, and nobody knows how to make any sense of it without quitting their day job.

A science futures market can fix these problems.

And I believe that the first version -- with which the kinks will be ironed out -- should be used to evaluate specialist expertise on a social network dedicated to scientific controversies.

## Welcome to the Science Futures API

This repo will house an API gateway to that system.

(Please note that this is not the only system for scientific prediction that we can construct; there will also be a user bio questionnaire which will act as a system to track changes in worldviews.)
